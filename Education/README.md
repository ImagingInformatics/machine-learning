## The SIIM Machine Learning Education Subcommittee 

The v is under the SIIM ML Committee led by Steve Langer and George Shih.

This repo is intended to provide educational resources in different levels of knowledge for those interested in improving their ML skills.

The content is being updated periodically, so stay tunned.

If you want to **contribute with your educational material**, get in contact with **kitamura.felipe@gmail.com**

Notebooks marked with ✔️ are ready to use. Those marked with 🚧 will be realeased soon.

SIIM ML Education Subcommittee is also working towards improving reproducible ML research. The subcommitte has developed a rubric to evaluate classification ML models. The [arXiv paper Best Practices and Scoring System on Reviewing A.I. based Medical Imaging Papers: Part 1 Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01863) describes the checklist. There is a spreadsheet version of the rubric available for use [here]().
