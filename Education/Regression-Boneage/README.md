# Simple Regression Model for Bone Age with Pytorch

## SIIM Github Repo

### Task 

Train a deep learning model to estimate the Bone Age from a hand-wrist radiograph. This is an example of a regression model.

### Requirements

1. Basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning
2. Programming in Python

### Learning objectives

At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

1. Understand how to organize your data to use it to train a deep learning model
2. Use a custom data handler in Pytorch to access your dataset to train a model
3. Modify an open source convolutional neural network (EfficientNe B0)
4. Train a model
5. Calculate metrics in the Validation and Test sets
