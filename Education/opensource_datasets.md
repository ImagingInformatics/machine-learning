## The SIIM Machine Learning Education Subcommittee 

### Open Source Datasets

The SIIM Machine Learning Education Subcommittee is under the SIIM ML Committee led by Steve Langer and George Shih.

This repo is intended to provide educational resources in different levels of knowledge for those interested in improving their ML skills.

The content is being updated periodically, so stay tunned.

If you want to **contribute with your own dataset** or if you know of other **open source datasets not listed here**, get in contact with **kitamura.felipe@gmail.com** so we can add the references to this repo.

Below, you can find open source medical imaging datasets for machine learning:
