# Simple Binary Classifier using Keras

## SIIM Github Repo

### Task 

Train a deep learning model to classify sagittal T1 MRI sequences into pre- or post-contrast.

### Requirements

1. Basic understanding of machine learning and deep learning
2. Programming in Python

### Learning objectives

At the end of this activity, you will be able to:

1. Understand how to organize your data to use it to train a deep learning model
2. Use the standard data handler from Keras (DataGenerator) to access your dataset to train a model
3. Create a custom convolutional neural network
4. Train a model
5. Calculate metrics in the Validation and Test sets
