# Welcome to the git repository of the Machine Learning Committee of SIIM. 

Under the machine-learning umbrella, you will find sub modules of code
committed by individuals who are willing to share their code with SiiM. 
By convention, the Committee is encouraging participants to base their
submissions on Juypyter (formerly iPy) notebooks to make it easy to 
contribute, download, run and modify.

Of course, notebooks need a runtime platform to run on. Towards that end,
thanks to Dr. George Shih MD for kicking off this effort with his Docker 
that builds Jupyter on the  deep learning framework Keras on TensorFLow. Each 
code contributor is asked to bundle all relevant documentation to their
notebooks in their commit. 

The Machine Learning Commitee has several sub-commitees: Education, Tools and Research, and Industry Liason. Contributions from the first two are in their respective folders. Contributions from third parties can be found in the folder "Non-SiiM Contributions". The Documentation folder is reserved for HOWTO's relevant to the entire
project.
