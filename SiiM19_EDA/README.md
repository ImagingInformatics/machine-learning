This is a talk for the June 2019 SIIM meeting on Exploratory Data Analysis.

We explored the dataset from the [RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge).

We acknowledge that we based our analysis in significant part on kernels such as:

* https://www.kaggle.com/zahaviguy/what-are-lung-opacities
* https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/rsna-pneumonia-detection-eda
* https://www.kaggle.com/peterchang77/exploratory-data-analysis
* https://www.kaggle.com/aantonova/practical-eda-on-numerical-data

We do not go into training the data or any machine learning of a dataset within this talk, this is within the scope of other talks.
